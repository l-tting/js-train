**INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT**
-> A web application has the following building blocks:
1.HTML - defines the structure / content of the webpage
2.CSS - defines the appearance of the webpage
3.JS  - enable user interactivity

**What do we use JS for?**
1.User Interactivity - webpage responding to user actions e.g typing, clicking buttons,
scrolling,hovering e.t.c
2.Reactivity - making our pages dynamic -> the page content is able to change itself 
without reloading

**JS can run in two environments:
1. In the browser -> client side JS
2. In the server -> NodeJS


**Where can we write JS?**
-> depends on how much JS code you have to write
1.Internal JS -> witing JS inside a HTML document
        a) In the head section - if you want to run JS before HTML
        b) In the body section - right above the closing body tag (common)
2.External JS -( best way)
----> for a large JS codebase
---> create an external JS file with a .js extension
---->link your external script to html using src attribute in script element

** JS is a high level, interpreted language that makes web applications interactive

1.VARIABLES
-> Named container / memory space used to store values
-> How to declare variables in JS
1. Using the let keyword 
    -> the most common way
    -> used when you want to reassign / change the value of a variable
    e.g let x = 5 // declaration & assignment
        x = 12 // reassignment

2. Using the const keyword
    -> represents constant values
    -> values here cant be changed or reassigned
    -> e.g. const pi = 3.142

3. Using the var keyword - outdated
    -> works just like 'let'
    -> was replaced by let
    -> works in older browsers 

**DATA TYPES**
1.String - sequence of characters / text enclosed in quotations
2.Number - represents numeric values - both whole (integers) and decimal
3.Boolean - represents Truth values - true and false

->How to output in JS?
**console.log()

-> Checking for data type in JS
** typeof()



**Comments**
-> A way of documenting code -commented lines are ignored by the interpreter
->Types of comments:
1.Multiline comment -> /* */
2.Single line comment - //

**STRING METHODS & OPERATIONS**
-Methods are inbuilt functions used to manipulate data

1.Concatenation - joining or combining strings 
            a) Using "+" operator
            b) using concat() method
2.Template literals - a way of embedding or including variables inside strings
        -use backticks, $ and {}
3.Accessing characters in a string - strings are ordered - use indexing
        N/B:- In accessing string characters in JS , we dont have -ve indexing
4.Determine no of characters in a string - .length
5. .slice() - returns the portion / substring of a full string
        .slice(start,end)
        **slice allows -ve indexing
6. .toUpperCase() - converts a string to uppercase format
7. .toLowerCase() - converts a string to lowercase format
8. .includes() - determines whether a specified character or substring is part of a string
            -returns a Boolean value
9. .startsWith() - checks whether a string begins with a specified character or substring
10. .endsWith() - checks whether a string ends with a specified character or substring
                - return Boolean values
11. .indexOf() - returns the first occurrence of a specified character or characters
        e.g "Hello"
12. .replace() - replaces  specified character/s with a new value
            .replace(old_value, new_value)
13. .trim() - removing whitespaces from a string
            - trimLeft() or trimStart()
            - trimRight() or trimEnd()
14.split()


**NUMERIC OPERATIONS**
1.addition -> +
2.subtraction -> -
3.division - /
4.multiplication - *
6.exponent - **
7.modulus - %
8.increment -> ++ -> increase by 1
9. decrement -> -- -> decrease by 1
10. .toString() - changes a number to a string
11. .toFixed() - rounds off a number to specified decimal places
12. Math.round() - rounds a number to the nearest integer
13. Math.floor() - round down
14. Math.ceil() - round up

**TASK**
1.slide 53
2.slide 57

                        **LESSON 2**
**User Input**
-Makes programs interactive and dynamic
-In JS we take user input using prompt()
-Any data coming from user input is always a string
**Changing Data Type**
**String -> Number
**Number -> String
**Boolean conversions

1.Type conversion -> manual changing of data from one type to another
                -> explicitly done by the programmer
        **Convert string to number**
        a)Number() - convert string to number
        b)parseInt() - convert string to integer
        c)parseFloat() -convert string to decimal number

        **Convert number to string**
        a) String()
        b).toString()

2.Type coercion - where data is automatically changed from one type to another by 
                the language / interpreter 
                -> not changed by the programmer
        -> Polymorphism -> operator overloading -> an operator takes more than one form
        + -> concat -> addition

**JS OPERATORS**
-> Operators are symbols used to perfom specific tasks
-> We have 4 categories of operators:
1.Arithmetic Operators -numeric operations
-> + (addition)
-> - (subtract)
-> / (divide)
-> * (multiply)
-> ** (exponential)
-> % (modulus)
-> ++(increment) - increases by 1
-> --(decrement) - decreases by 1

2.Comparison Operators -compares values
-> == (loose equality) -> type coercion happens -> checks only for the value not data type
-> ===(strict equality) -> no type coercion -> checks for both value and data type
-> != (loose inequality)
-> !==(strict inequality)
-> > (greater than)
-> < (less than)
-> >= (greater than or equal to)
-> <= (less than or equal to)

3.Logical Operators - logical operations
-> Logical and - && ->  returns true only if both conditions are true
-> Logical or -> || -> returns true if t least on condition is true
-> Logical not -> ! - returns the opposite of a Boolean value


4.Assignment Operators - assigns values
-> = (assign)
-> += (add and assign)
-> -= (subtract nd assign)
-> *= (multiply and assign)
-> /= (divide and assign)
-> **= (raise to a number and assign)
-> %= (get remainder and assign)


**Task**
1.Find out what the 'in' operator does and illustrate with Javascript code - use w3schools or geeksforgeeks as references
2. Write a program that takes 2 numeric user inputs and outputs the following:
  -> their sum
  -> their subtraction
  -> their modulus
  -> their exponent
3.review & redo any undone task on slide 57
